## Domain-Specific Pattern Types

**Jake's world is crypto trading, so expect:**
- **ENTITY_PROJECT:** Crypto projects, DeFi protocols, NFT collections

## Personalization Notes

**Future customization opportunities:**
- Adjust salience weighting based on Jake's unique trauma responses
- Custom pattern types for crypto-specific experiences (e.g., "RUG_MEMORY", "PUMP_FOMO")
- Subentity-specific link strength modifiers (Conspiracy Theorist amplifies threat links 1.5x)
- Time-of-day nodes (late-night trading = Degen Gambler more active)

For now, use the standard Memory Keeper process from `memory_keeper.md`.
