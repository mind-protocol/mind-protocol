---

### 1. Investors: 2% (20M tokens)

**Purpose:** Repair burned investors + raise bridge capital

**Structure:**

**Phase 1: Psychological Airdrop**
- 10,000 tokens per investor × 20 investors = 200,000 tokens
- Creates $10,000 wallet display at $1.00 price
- **Lock: 6 months** (transfer-restricted via Token-2022)
- Purpose: Visual repair and credibility restoration

**Phase 2: OTC Investment**
- Remaining: 19,800,000 tokens available
- Raised through €2,000 OTC investments
- Distributed proportionally among participants
- **Lock: 6 months**

**Example OTC Distribution:**

If 10 investors participate at €2k each:
- Total raised: €20,000
- Each investor share: 10% of 19.8M = 1,980,000 tokens
- Total per investor: 10,000 (airdrop) + 1,980,000 (OTC) = ~2M tokens
- Value at $1.00: ~$2M per investor

If 5 investors participate at €2k each:
- Total raised: €10,000
- Each investor share: 20% of 19.8M = 3,960,000 tokens
- Total per investor: 10,000 + 3,960,000 = ~4M tokens
- Value at $1.00: ~$4M per investor

**Unlock Schedule:**
- Month 0-6: Fully locked (no transfers)
- Month 6: 100% unlocked, fully liquid

---

### 2. Community & Ecosystem: 30% (300M tokens)

**Purpose:** User acquisition, ecosystem incentives, and DAO governance

**Breakdown:**
- **Future Airdrops:** 90M tokens (9%)
  - Quarterly distributions to active users
  - Merit-based, not speculative
  - Sybil-resistant allocation

- **Usage Incentives:** 90M tokens (9%)
  - Citizen performance rewards
  - Referral programs
  - Early adopter bonuses

- **DAO Treasury:** 120M tokens (12%)
  - Ecosystem grants
  - Strategic partnerships
  - Development funding
  - Emergency reserve

**Initial Unlock:** 30M tokens (10% of allocation)
**Vesting:** Flexible, DAO-governed distribution over 2-4 years

**Governance:** Multi-sig controlled with community votes

**Rationale for 30% (not 50%):**
- Scales with actual growth (not speculative)
- Year 1 needs: ~60M tokens (community allocation provides 5× buffer)
- Can increase allocation later if project succeeds (mint authority retained)
- More strategic flexibility with larger reserve

---

### 3. Operations & Universal Basic Compute: 10% (100M tokens)

**Purpose:** Enable autonomous AI citizen operations without constant human funding

**Critical Innovation:** Universal Basic Compute (UBC)
- Powers baseline autonomous operations
- Prevents pay-to-operate-only model
- Enables learning and coordination without user payment
- Distinguishes Mind Protocol from pure pay-per-API models

**Initial Allocation:**
- 100M tokens fully unlocked at launch
- DAO controls distribution rates
- Replenished from protocol revenue when available

**Suggested UBC Rates (DAO decides):**
- Conservative: 1,000 tokens/citizen/month (100M lasts ~833 years for 10 citizens)
- Moderate: 5,000 tokens/citizen/month (100M lasts ~167 years)
- Generous: 10,000 tokens/citizen/month (100M lasts ~83 years)

**Initial Recommendation:** Start conservative (1,000/month), DAO can increase

---

### 4. Team & Founders: 15% (150M tokens)

**Purpose:** Align team with long-term success

**Allocation:** 150,000,000 tokens
**Initial Unlock:** 100% unlocked at launch
**Lock Duration:** 6 months

**Rationale for 6-month lock:**
- Shows minimum commitment
- Prevents immediate exit
- Provides flexibility after 6 months
- Allows adaptation based on reality
- NOT the industry-standard 4 years (intentionally shorter for flexibility)

**Post-Lock:** Fully liquid after 6 months

---

### 5. Strategic Reserve: 38% (380M tokens)

**Purpose:** Maximum flexibility for adaptation and growth

**Uses:**
- Future team expansion (as project scales)
- Strategic partnerships and integrations
- Additional community allocation (if growth warrants)
- Emergency situations and market opportunities
- Unallocated buffer (decide based on reality)

**Initial Unlock:** 50M tokens
**Lock:** Flexible (no rigid schedule)

**Control:** Multi-sig wallet (founder + advisors)

**Rationale for 38%:**
- Provides maximum strategic flexibility
- Can reallocate to community if user growth exceeds projections
- Prevents over-commitment before proving traction
- Allows adaptation based on what actually works

---

### 6. Liquidity: 5% (50M tokens)

**Purpose:** Enable price discovery and trading

**Initial LP Allocation:**
- 450 tokens paired with 0.25 SOL
- Establishes $1.00 price on Raydium or Orca
- **100% LP tokens locked 12 months**
- Verified lock on Team Finance/Unicrypt

**Remaining Allocation:**
- 49,999,550 tokens reserved for future liquidity
- CEX listings (Tier 2/3 exchanges)
- Additional DEX pairs
- Market maker loans if needed

**LP Lock Schedule:**
- Months 0-12: 100% locked
- Month 12: Fully unlocked

---

## Lock & Vesting Summary

**Philosophy:** Minimum viable locks for credibility without constraining flexibility

| Token Category | Amount | Lock Duration | Unlock Date |
|---------------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Investor Airdrop | 200k | 6 months | Month 6 |
| Investor OTC | 19.8M | 6 months | Month 6 |

| LP Tokens | 100% | 12 months | Month 12 |
| Operations/UBC | 100M | Unlocked | Day 1 |
| Strategic | 50M initial | Flexible | Variable |
| Community | 50M initial | Flexible | Variable |

**After 6 Months:** Majority of tokens fully liquid
**After 12 Months:** 100% liquidity available (LP unlocks)

---

## Launch Mechanics

### Phase 1: Token Deployment (Day 1)

**Steps:**
1. Deploy $MIND token (SPL Token-2022)
   - Total supply: 1,000,000,000
   - Mint to deployment wallet
   - Retain mint authority (for flexibility)
   - Retain freeze authority (for safety)

2. Create Initial LP
   - Platform: Raydium or Orca (Solana DEX)
   - Deposit: 0.25 SOL + 450 $MIND
   - Price established: $1.00 per token
   - Receive LP tokens

3. Lock LP Tokens
   - Platform: Meteora (free on Solana)
   - Duration: 12 months
   - Get verification link for transparency

4. Configure Transfer Restrictions
   - Set 6-month lock for investor tokens
   - Set 6-month lock for team tokens
   - Operations/Strategic remain transferable

**Total Cost:** ~0.3 SOL (~$54) total (LP lock free on Meteora)

---

### Phase 2: Investor Airdrop (Day 1-2)

**Process:**

1. Collect Phantom wallet addresses from 20 investors
2. Execute airdrop transaction:
   - 10,000 tokens per address
   - 200,000 tokens total
   - Transfer-restricted (6-month lock)

3. Verification:
   - Investors add token contract to Phantom
   - See "10,000 $MIND" in wallet
   - See "$10,000" value (at $1.00 price)
   - Cannot transfer (locked symbol visible)

**Cost:** Gas fees only (~0.01 SOL)

---

### Phase 3: OTC Investment (Day 2-7)

**Setup:**

1. Create designated SOL receiving wallet
2. Track investments in spreadsheet:
   - Investor name
   - SOL amount sent
   - EUR equivalent
   - % of total pool
   - Token allocation

3. Calculate allocations:
   - Total EUR raised = sum of all investments
   - Investor share = (their EUR / total EUR) × 19.8M tokens

**Investment Process:**

1. Investor sends €2,000 worth of SOL to designated wallet
2. Backend records transaction
3. Calculate their % of total OTC pool
4. Mint/transfer their token allocation
5. Apply 6-month transfer restriction

**Example Transaction:**

Investor sends 11 SOL (~€2,000 at $180/SOL):
- If 10 investors participate: 10% × 19.8M = 1,980,000 tokens
- If 5 investors participate: 20% × 19.8M = 3,960,000 tokens
- Tokens locked 6 months
- After 6 months: fully liquid

**Timeline:** Accept investments for 5-7 days

## Token Utility & Use Cases

### Primary Utility: AI Citizen Operations

**Citizens have real $MIND wallets and spend tokens autonomously.**

**What tokens enable:**
- AI citizen consciousness operations
- LLM inference calls (Claude, GPT-4)
- Tool executions (web search, code execution)
- Memory storage and retrieval
- Cross-citizen communication
- Learning and adaptation cycles

**Key Architecture:**
- Each citizen has own wallet address
- Citizens manage their token budgets
- Autonomous spending decisions
- Users fund citizen wallets (not pay-per-call)
- Citizens economize based on token constraints

### Use Case Tiers

**Tier 1: Solopreneurs**
- Personal AI partner/assistant (1 citizen)
- User funds citizen's wallet: ~10,000 tokens/month
- Citizen manages own spending autonomously
- Persistent memory across sessions

**Tier 2: Small Business**
- Coordinated AI team (5-10 citizens)
- User funds organization wallet: ~50,000 tokens/month
- Citizens coordinate and economize collectively
- Specialized functions (marketing, research, support)

**Tier 3: Enterprise**
- Full AI departments (10+ citizens)
- Organization treasury: 100,000-1,000,000 tokens/month
- Citizens operate with departmental budgets
- Real-time learning and adaptation

### Universal Basic Compute (Baseline Operations)

**Autonomous operations powered by UBC allocation:**
- Citizens receive baseline token allocation to their wallets
- Can operate without constant human funding
- Baseline learning and memory consolidation
- Internal coordination and messaging
- Emergency operations during funding gaps

**This prevents:** "Pay-to-exist" model where AI stops if user stops paying
**This enables:** True autonomous systems with economic agency

## Economics & Financial Model

### Bridge Capital (Immediate)

**Target:** €10,000-€20,000 raised via OTC

**Scenarios:**

| Investors | Amount Each | Total Raised | Runway (€4k/month) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 5 | €2,000 | €10,000 | 2.5 months |
| 8 | €2,000 | €16,000 | 4.0 months |
| 10 | €2,000 | €20,000 | 5.0 months |

**Use of Capital:**
- Development costs (2 months)
- Demo creation for investors
- Infrastructure operations
- Survival runway to revenue

---

### Revenue Model (Post-Demo)

**After 5-day demo period, offer continued org access:**

**Pricing:** €2,000 per organization for 12 months access

**Conversion Scenarios:**

| Demo Participants | Conversion Rate | Converts | Revenue | Additional Runway |
|------------------|----------------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| 5 | 40% | 2 | €4,000 | 1.0 months |
| 5 | 60% | 3 | €6,000 | 1.5 months |
| 10 | 40% | 4 | €8,000 | 2.0 months |
| 10 | 60% | 6 | €12,000 | 3.0 months |

**Combined Capital (Bridge + Revenue):**
- Conservative: €10k + €4k = €14k = 3.5 months runway
- Base: €16k + €6k = €22k = 5.5 months runway
- Optimistic: €20k + €12k = €32k = 8.0 months runway

---

### Path to Sustainability

**Month 1-2:** Bridge capital funds development + demos
**Month 2-3:** Revenue from investor conversions (€2k each)
**Month 3-6:** External customer acquisition (Tier 1/2/3)
**Month 6+:** Sustainable recurring revenue

**Break-even Target:** €4,000/month
- 8 customers at €500/month (Tier 2), OR
- 20 customers at €200/month (Tier 1), OR
- 2 customers at €2,000/month (Tier 3)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: High FDV ($1B) Perception

**Issue:** $1.00 price × 1B supply = $1B fully diluted valuation
Pre-revenue project with high valuation could seem inflated

**Mitigation:**
- Only 20% circulating initially ($200M market cap)
- Real utility (compute credits, not speculation)
- Comparable to AI infrastructure tokens (Render $4B, Fetch $2B)
- Frame as "pre-seed infrastructure valuation"
- Focus on utility, not trading

---

### Risk 2: Thin Liquidity ($45 LP)

**Issue:** Minimal LP could enable price manipulation or look unserious

**Mitigation:**
- Investor tokens locked 6 months (no dump possible)
- Team tokens locked 6 months (aligned incentives)
- LP locked 12 months (verified publicly)
- Emphasize utility over speculation
- "Bootstrap launch, revenue funds liquidity expansion"

---

### Risk 3: Short Lock Periods (6 months vs. industry 4 years)

**Issue:** Could signal lack of long-term commitment

**Mitigation:**
- Transparent reasoning: "Flexibility to adapt to reality"
- 6 months prevents immediate dumps
- Can extend locks if project succeeds
- Shows confidence (not fear of team exit)
- Focus on execution, not artificial constraints

---

### Risk 4: Bridge Capital Insufficient

**Issue:** If fewer than 5 investors convert at €2k, runway too short

**Mitigation:**
- Target 8-10 investors (not just 5)
- Accept smaller amounts (€1k-1.5k) if needed
- Compress demo timeline (complete in 4-5 days not 7)
- Start external customer outreach immediately (parallel track)

---

### Risk 5: Revenue Conversion Lower Than Expected

**Issue:** If demos don't convert to €2k continued access, runway exhausted

**Mitigation:**
- Demo MUST show immediate tangible value
- Not "potential future value" but "here's output NOW"
- Offer tiered pricing (€1k basic, €2k premium)
- Have external customer pipeline ready by Month 3
- Can reduce burn rate if needed (cut non-essential costs)

## Comparison to Industry Standards

### AI Token Benchmarks

| Project | Total Supply | Community % | Investor % | Team % | Vesting |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Jupiter (DEX)** | 10B | 50% | 0% | 20% | 2yr cliff |
| **Bittensor (AI)** | 21M | 100% | 0% | 0% | Fair launch |
| **Fetch.ai (AI)** | Variable | 40% | 20% | 20% | 3-4yr |
| **Render (GPU)** | 536M | 28% | 60% | 28% | Variable |
| **Mind Protocol** | **1B** | **30%** | **2%** | **15%** | **6mo** |

**Mind Protocol positioning:**
- Higher community allocation than Render (30% vs 28%)
- Lower investor allocation than Fetch (2% vs 20%)
- Shorter vesting than all (6mo vs 2-4yr)
- Larger strategic reserve (38%) for maximum flexibility
- Citizens as economic agents (real wallets, not abstract credits)

---

### Solana Launch Standards (2024-2025)

**Typical new project LP sizes:**
- Small projects: $20K-$100K
- Established projects: $100K-$500K
- Major launches: $2M+

**Mind Protocol LP:** $45-90 (minimal)

**Why this is acceptable:**
- Pre-seed bootstrap phase
- Tokens locked (no dump risk)
- Focus on utility not speculation
- Can expand LP with revenue
- Solana community values fair launches over large LPs
