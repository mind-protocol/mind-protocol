In the meantime, what I think you could be doing that would be super useful is that for each Python script have an associated documentation. It doesn't need to be 1:1, but basically I think if you could build sort of a documentation map of what script is defined in what document that would be super useful for when you will do the implementation phase. What do you think about that?Btw, this is supposed to be exactly stored in the level 2 network as a document and implements link and code nodes. But in the meantime, we might do that in a MD file, and it could be good enough."
