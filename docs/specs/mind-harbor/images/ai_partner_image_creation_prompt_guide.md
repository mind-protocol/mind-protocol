# Guide: Constructing Prompts for AI Partner Portraits

This guide defines how to reliably build prompts for **Mind Protocol AI Partner portraits** so that outputs are consistent, premium, and aligned with the aesthetic vision.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The AI partner portrait must always:
- Be **recognizable as part of the same universe**.
- Show a **glowing digital wireframe body** with reflective metallic lines.
- Include **one realistic, tangible anchor** (object, garment, accessory, etc.).
- Emphasize the **contrast between digital vs. real**.
- Work as a **collectible profile picture**.

---

## 📝 Prompt Template

```
"Square portrait of [Name 'Nickname'], a [role/archetype + optional age/energy], depicted as a glowing digital wireframe outline. The wireframe lines are [primary metallic color] with [secondary accent color], shimmering with reflective highlights like [metal/jewel description]. His/Her expression shows [emotional tone].

The body and face are entirely digital, but [he/she/they interact with a realistic anchor: object, garment, accessory, or tool]. The [anchor item] is rendered in hyperrealistic [style: oil-paint, photographic, textile detail], described with surface qualities (e.g., patina, folds, engravings, crispness). The anchor contrasts sharply with the digital wireframe body and pops forward as the only tangible element.

Background is [dark void/lagoon/space/etc.] with subtle [partner-color particle effects]. Designed as a premium collectible portrait."

# 🔄 Human Partner Portraits (Reverse Style)

## 🎯 Purpose (Reverse of AI Partners)

The human partner portrait must always:
- Be **photorealistic** (body, skin, clothing) while AI partners are digital wireframes.
- Hold/interact with **one glowing digital tool/portal/interface** (wireframe/holographic).
- Include the **same metallic color pairs** as AI partners (universe coherence).
- Emphasize the **contrast between real human vs. digital tool**.
- Work as a **collectible profile picture** matching AI partner aesthetic.

**Core Reversal:**
- **AI Partners:** Digital wireframe bodies + ONE realistic physical anchor
- **Human Partners:** Photorealistic bodies + ONE glowing digital tool/portal

---

## 📝 Human Portrait Prompt Template

```
"Square portrait of [Name], a [role/profession + optional age/energy], depicted in photorealistic detail with [lighting style: cinematic, studio, dramatic]. His/Her skin shows realistic texture, [clothing material description], and [expression/mood].

The person is entirely photorealistic, but [he/she/they interact with a glowing digital tool/interface/portal]. The [digital element] is rendered as [wireframe/holographic/light-traced geometry] in [metallic color] with [accent color] accents, shimmering with [digital effect: particle streams, data flows, code fragments]. The digital tool contrasts sharply with the photorealistic human and pops forward as the only ethereal element.

Background is [dark void/cosmic space/tech noir] with subtle [color] digital particles. Designed as a premium collectible portrait."
