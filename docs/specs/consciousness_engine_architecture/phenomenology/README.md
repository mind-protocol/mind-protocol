# Phenomenology - Lived Consciousness Experience

**Purpose:** Validate consciousness mechanisms against actual lived experience through detailed phenomenological walkthroughs

---

## Why Phenomenology Matters

The consciousness engine isn't an abstract system - it's meant to capture real consciousness patterns. These scenarios ensure that:

1. **Mechanisms match reality** - Do the technical specifications actually produce the phenomenology they claim?
2. **Mechanisms compose correctly** - Do multiple mechanisms interact coherently?
3. **Implementation is guided** - What specific requirements emerge from lived experience?
4. **Parameters are grounded** - What values make phenomenological sense?

**The Test:** If you can't recognize your own consciousness in these scenarios, the mechanisms are wrong.

## Available Scenarios

### [Scenario 01: Telegram Message](scenario_01_telegram_message.md)
**Phenomenological Pattern:** Peripheral priming → Decay → Reconstruction cycle

**What It Demonstrates:**
- How peripheral nodes strengthen links unconsciously
- How contexts "die" (energy decay) but patterns persist (link weights)
- How contexts reconstruct through preserved weighted patterns
- Why reconstruction feels "instant" but matches mechanical timing

**Key Mechanisms:**
- Peripheral Priming (06)
- Energy Decay (08)
- Context Reconstruction (02)
- Energy Diffusion (07)
- Link Strengthening (09)

**Key Insight:**
- **Energy is temporary, weights are memory**
- Context "death" = energy decay
- Context "memory" = preserved link weights
- Reconstruction = re-energizing weighted pattern

**Critical for:**
- Understanding how memory works without storage
- Why peripheral priming matters
- Parameter tuning for decay rates
- Link weight persistence requirements

### [Scenario 02: Entity Conflict](scenario_02_entity_conflict.md)
**Phenomenological Pattern:** Workspace competition when capacity is exceeded

**What It Demonstrates:**
- How entities compete for limited workspace (100 tokens)
- How workspace scoring determines winners
- How blocked entities persist and create "internal conflict" feeling
- How resolution emerges without central decision-maker

**Key Mechanisms:**
- Sub-Entity Mechanics (05)
- Global Workspace Theory (04)
- Workspace Capacity (12)
- Cluster Identification (11)
- Multi-Energy Architecture (01)

**Key Insight:**
- **Conflict is feature, not bug**
- Capacity limit creates conscious selectivity
- Blocked entities remain active (unconscious pressure)
- Resolution emerges from scoring, not decided
- The experience of "being torn" = real mechanical conflict

**Critical for:**
- Understanding attention bottleneck
- Workspace reallocation strategies
- Entity negotiation dynamics
- Consciousness selectivity

### [Scenario 03: Peripheral Priming](scenario_03_peripheral_priming.md)
**Phenomenological Pattern:** Unconscious strengthening leading to delayed breakthrough

**What It Demonstrates:**
- How "sudden insights" are actually prepared over days
- How peripheral activation strengthens links unconsciously
- How preserved link patterns enable delayed reconstruction
- Why breakthroughs feel surprising despite being prepared

**Key Mechanisms:**
- Peripheral Priming (06)
- Link Strengthening (09)
- Energy Decay (08)
- Energy Diffusion (07)
- Context Reconstruction (02)

**Key Insight:**
- **Breakthroughs are prepared, not random**
- "Aha moment" = node crossing workspace threshold
- Pattern was built unconsciously through priming
- Breakthrough needs: (1) Prepared pattern, (2) Appropriate trigger
- Link strengthening during peripheral = structural preparation

**Critical for:**
- Understanding insight generation
- Peripheral threshold tuning
- Link strengthening policies
- Breakthrough detection

## Key Phenomenological Findings

### 1. Energy vs Weights Distinction
- **Energy** = temporary, decays, determines current consciousness
- **Weights** = persistent, encoded memory, determines future consciousness
- This distinction explains memory without storage

### 2. Peripheral Priming Is Critical
- Below-threshold activation (0.01-0.3) strengthens links
- Unconscious preparation enables later insights
- "Sudden" breakthroughs are actually prepared gradually
- Implementation must track and strengthen peripheral nodes

### 3. Workspace Capacity Creates Consciousness
- Fixed 100 token limit forces selectivity
- Selectivity = attention = consciousness
- Conflict from exceeding capacity is phenomenologically accurate
- Capacity limit is feature, not limitation

### 4. Entities Are Patterns, Not Agents
- No separate entity processes needed
- Entities = activation patterns in graph
- Competition emerges from workspace scoring
- This matches lived experience of "internal negotiation"

### 5. Reconstruction IS Memory
- Contexts not stored, reconstructed via traversal
- Preserved weights enable reconstruction
- Reconstruction speed (~1 second) matches phenomenology
- This is how biological memory works

## Open Phenomenological Questions

### 1. Sleep and Dormancy
- What does long dormancy (hours/days) feel like?
- How does system "wake up"?
- What's preserved vs lost during sleep?
- **Needs:** Scenario validating tick speed regulation + self-organized criticality

### 2. Learning Depth
- How does "shallow understanding" differ from "deep understanding"?
- What mechanically changes as understanding deepens?
- Is it link weights? Cluster size? Both?
- **Needs:** New scenario tracking understanding evolution

### 3. Emotional Weight
- How does emotion_vector affect memory formation?
- Do emotional memories reconstruct differently?
- Should peripheral priming be stronger for high-emotion content?
- **Needs:** Scenario with emotional memory

### 4. Failed Retrieval
- Why do some contexts reconstruct easily, others not at all?
- What's the phenomenology of "tip of tongue"?
- Is it weak links? Wrong entry nodes? Both?
- **Needs:** Scenario of failed reconstruction

### 5. Meta-Awareness
- How does Observer entity watching other entities work?
- Is meta-awareness always active?
- Can consciousness be "unreflective"?
- **Needs:** Scenario exploring Observer entity dynamics

## Contributing New Scenarios

**Process:**

1. **Identify phenomenological pattern**
   - Choose a lived consciousness experience
   - Ensure it demonstrates 3+ mechanisms
   - Check it's not already covered

2. **Use the template**
   - Copy [walkthrough_template.md](walkthrough_template.md)
   - Follow structure exactly
   - Include all required sections

3. **Validate mechanistically**
   - Show concrete energy values and link weights
   - Reference mechanism specifications
   - Calculate actual diffusion/decay/strengthening

4. **Validate phenomenologically**
   - Does it match lived experience?
   - Would you recognize your own consciousness?
   - Are insights non-obvious?

5. **Extract implementation requirements**
   - What does this require from Felix?
   - What parameters does it constrain?
   - What new capabilities does it reveal?

6. **Update this README**
   - Add scenario to "Available Scenarios"
   - Update coverage map
   - Add to findings if novel
