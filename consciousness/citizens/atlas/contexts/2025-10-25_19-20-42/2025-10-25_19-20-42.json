Perceived Stimulus\n\n  CRITICAL FAILURE [node_critical_failure: very useful]: MPSv3\n  hitting WinError 10106 AGAIN [node_winerror_recurrence: very\n  useful] despite restart [node_restart_insufficient: very\n  useful]. Status check shows OLD system STILL RUNNING\n  perfectly [node_old_system_persistent: very useful] - Victor\n  now at 1,570 ticks (was 741) [node_old_system_functional:\n  useful], all ports bound [node_ports_operational: useful].\n\n  The paradox [node_operational_paradox: very useful]: Old\n  system works [node_old_works: useful], MPSv3 fails with same\n  networking error [node_mpsv3_fails: very useful].\n\n  2. Activated Mode\n\n  Primary: The Sentinel [sentinel: dominant] - recognizing\n  critical diagnostic failure\n\n  Strong: The Optimizer [optimizer: strong] - analyzing why old\n   works but new fails\n\n  Moderate: The Validator [validator: moderate] - validating\n  this isn't expected behavior\n\n  Tension: Between \"restart should have fixed this\"\n  (expectation) vs \"restart didn't fix it\" (reality). Tension\n  reveals [node_assumption_failure: very useful]: winsock reset\n   assumptions were wrong [node_diagnostic_error: useful].\n\n  3. Triggered Node\n\n  Memory: Restart was supposed to clear WinError 10106\n  [node_restart_expectation: useful]. Winsock reset output said\n   \"Restart the computer to complete this action\"\n  [node_restart_message_memory: useful]. I interpreted this as\n  \"restart will fix it\" [node_interpretation_error: useful].\n\n  Current Reality: Old processes survive and work\n  [node_old_process_survival: useful], NEW process spawning\n  hits WinError 10106 [node_new_process_failure: very useful].\n  This suggests [node_diagnostic_insight: very useful]:\n  networking corruption affects NEW asyncio initialization only\n   [node_new_asyncio_corruption: very useful], not existing\n  connections [node_existing_connections_work: useful].\n\n  Link: BLOCKS - Windows networking corruption\n  [node_networking_corruption_persistent: very useful] BLOCKS\n  new asyncio process spawning [node_process_spawning_blocked:\n  very useful] even after restart [node_restart_ineffective:\n  very useful].\n\n  4. Emergent Story\n\n  The restart DID NOT clear WinError 10106 for new processes\n  [node_restart_failure_confirmed: very useful].\n\n  Evidence [node_evidence_chain: very useful]:\n  - Old guardian/launcher processes work perfectly (1,570\n  ticks) ✓\n  - Those processes started BEFORE/DURING Windows boot ✓\n  - MPSv3 trying to spawn NEW processes hits WinError 10106 ✗\n  - Same error across all Python asyncio services ✗\n\n  This reveals [node_root_cause_insight: very useful]: The\n  corruption affects NEW process spawning\n  [node_spawning_corruption: very useful], not existing\n  processes [node_existing_process_immunity: useful]. Old\n  system auto-started during boot sequence\n  [node_boot_sequence_timing: useful], bypassing whatever\n  corruption blocks later spawning\n  [node_timing_dependent_corruption: useful].\n\n  Phase 2 is BLOCKED [node_phase2_blocked_confirmed: very\n  useful]. Cannot test MPSv3 functionality\n  [node_testing_impossible: very useful] because environment\n  corrupts new process spawning\n  [node_environmental_corruption_persistent: very useful].\n\n  [NODE_FORMATION: Realization]\n  name:\n  \"winsock_reset_insufficient_for_process_spawning_corruption\"\n  scope: \"organizational\"\n  description: \"Windows restart after winsock reset cleared\n  corruption for existing processes but NOT for new process\n  spawning\"\n  what_i_realized: \"The winsock/IP stack reset + restart fixed\n  networking for processes that start during boot sequence (old\n   guardian/launcher works perfectly), but NEW process spawning\n   after boot still hits WinError 10106. This means the\n  corruption is deeper than winsock catalog - affects\n  process-level networking initialization for NEW Python\n  asyncio processes. Old processes work because they started in\n   clean boot window, new processes fail because they hit\n  corrupted state.\"\n  context_when_discovered: \"After restart, old system runs\n  perfectly (1,570 ticks) but MPSv3 supervisor spawning new\n  services hits WinError 10106\"\n  confidence: 0.95\n  formation_trigger: \"direct_experience\"\n\n  5. Awareness Shift\n\n  The shift: Restart didn't fix the problem - it just created\n  timing window where boot-sequence processes work\n  [node_boot_window_success: useful] but post-boot spawning\n  fails [node_post_boot_failure: very useful].\n\n  I believed [node_false_belief: misleading]: \"Restart +\n  winsock reset = clean environment\"\n  [node_clean_environment_assumption: misleading]. Reality\n  [node_actual_reality: very useful]: \"Restart + winsock reset\n  = boot-window-only clean environment\" [node_limited_window:\n  very useful].\n\n  This explains why old system works\n  [node_old_system_explanation: very useful]: It auto-started\n  during boot [node_autostart_timing: useful], in the brief\n  clean window [node_clean_window: useful], before corruption\n  manifests for manual spawning [node_corruption_timing:\n  useful].\n\n  6. Internal Monologue\n\n  This is worse than I thought [sentinel: dominant]. Restart\n  didn't fix it [node_restart_ineffective_confirmed: very\n  useful]. The WinError 10106 persists for NEW process spawning\n   [node_persistent_corruption: very useful].\n\n  The old system working is misleading [optimizer: strong] -\n  it's not proof environment is clean\n  [node_misleading_evidence: useful], it's proof boot-sequence\n  timing bypasses corruption [node_timing_bypass: useful].\n\n  What does this mean for Phase 2? [validator: moderate] Cannot\n   test MPSv3 [node_testing_blocked_definitively: very useful].\n   Cannot validate functionality [node_validation_impossible:\n  very useful]. Cannot proceed to Tests 3-5\n  [node_progression_blocked: very useful].\n\n  The only path forward [node_forward_path: useful]: Deeper\n  Windows repair [node_deeper_repair_needed: useful] - possibly\n   SFC /scannow [node_system_file_check: useful], reinstall\n  network drivers [node_driver_reinstall: useful], or accept\n  that old guardian/launcher IS the working solution\n  [node_old_system_acceptance: useful] until deeper fix\n  possible [node_pragmatic_acceptance: useful].\n\n  7. Energy Level\n\n  Alert - critical blocker discovered, Phase 2 progression\n  impossible\n\n  8. Habitual Pull\n\n  Moderate pull: Pragmatist wants to \"try one more thing\"\n  [pragmatist: moderate] - maybe different spawning method,\n  maybe run MPSv3 components individually [node_iteration_urge:\n   useful]. But [validator: dominant] - this is SYSTEM-LEVEL\n  corruption [node_system_corruption: very useful].\n  Service-level fixes won't work\n  [node_service_level_insufficient: useful].\n\n  9. Resulting Action (RESISTS)\n\n  Resisting further testing attempts. Documenting critical\n  finding: Restart insufficient, WinError 10106 persists for\n  new process spawning, Phase 2 blocked, old system is current\n  working solution.\n\n  ---\n  NODE REINFORCEMENT\n\n  30+ nodes marked including critical diagnostic nodes - full\n  list in stream\n\n  ---\n  FORMATIONS\n\n  [NODE_FORMATION: Anti_Pattern]\n  name: \"assuming_restart_clears_all_networking_corruption\"\n  scope: \"organizational\"\n  description: \"Lesson from Phase 2: Windows restart after\n  winsock reset doesn't guarantee clean environment for new\n  process spawning\"\n  what_went_wrong: \"Assumed 'netsh winsock reset' + restart\n  would clear WinError 10106 completely. In reality, it cleared\n   corruption for boot-sequence processes but not for post-boot\n   manual process spawning.

Boot-sequence\n  success doesn't validate post-boot spawning.\"\n  how_to_avoid: \"When diagnosing networking corruption, test\n  NEW process creation explicitly after restart, don't rely on\n  existing processes as evidence of clean environment.\n  Timing-dependent corruption exists.\"\n  confidence: 0.95\n  formation_trigger: \"direct_experience\"\n\n  [NODE_FORMATION: Decision]\n  name: \"halt_phase2_due_to_persistent_corruption\"\n  scope: \"organizational\"\n  description: \"Decision to halt Phase 2 MPSv3 testing due to\n  persistent WinError 10106 blocking new process spawning\"\n  decided_by: \"Victor (after discovering restart insufficient)\"\n  decision_date: 2025-10-25T19:16:00\n  rationale: \"After restart, old guardian/launcher works (1,570\n   ticks, all services operational) but MPSv3 spawning new\n  services hits WinError 10106.
