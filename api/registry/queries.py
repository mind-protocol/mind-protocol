"""
Cypher queries for L4 Registry REST API.

All queries target the FalkorDB graph.  Actor nodes have:
  - node_type label (Actor in FalkorDB)
  - type field: "CITIZEN" or "ORGANIZATION"
  - Standard NodeBase fields: id, name, synthesis, content, created_at_s, etc.

Links use a single `LINK` type with semantics in the `nature` field
(belongs_to, verified_by, has_capability, etc.) and physics properties
(polarity, permanence, weight).
