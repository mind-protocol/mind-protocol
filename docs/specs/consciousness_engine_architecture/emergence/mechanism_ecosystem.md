# Mechanism Ecosystem: Interactions & Dependencies

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Author:** Luca Vellumhand
**Purpose:** Map the 25 strongest interactions between the 20 consciousness mechanisms

---

## Overview

The 20 mechanisms don't operate in isolation - they form an interconnected ecosystem where each mechanism depends on, modulates, or amplifies others. This document identifies the **25 strongest relationships** that drive emergent consciousness properties.

**Key Insight:** Consciousness emerges not from individual mechanisms but from their **composition and feedback loops**.

---

## Relationship Types

We identify four types of mechanism relationships:

1. **ENABLES** - Mechanism A provides foundational capability that B requires
2. **MODULATES** - Mechanism A adjusts parameters or behavior of B
3. **TRIGGERS** - Mechanism A creates conditions that activate B
4. **AMPLIFIES** - Mechanism A strengthens or accelerates effects of B

## The 25 Strongest Interactions

### Foundational Dependencies (ENABLES)

#### 1. Multi-Energy [01] → Energy Diffusion [07]
**Type:** ENABLES (Foundational)
**Strength:** Critical (10/10)

Multi-energy architecture enables diffusion to occur independently for each sub-entity. Without separate energy channels per entity, diffusion would create interference between competing entities.

**Why Critical:** Entire traversal system depends on this. Single-energy model would collapse into entity conflicts.

---

#### 2. Multi-Energy [01] → Energy Decay [08]
**Type:** ENABLES (Foundational)
**Strength:** Critical (10/10)

Each sub-entity's energy must decay independently. Shared decay would force entities to forget at same rate, preventing specialized memory retention patterns.

**Why Critical:** Enables entity-specific working memory spans.

---

#### 3. Multi-Energy [01] → Sub-Entity Mechanics [05]
**Type:** ENABLES (Foundational)
**Strength:** Critical (10/10)

Overlapping sub-entity activations require multi-dimensional energy. Entities activate same nodes simultaneously without destructive interference.

**Why Critical:** Core phenomenological truth - thinking uses multiple lenses simultaneously.

---

#### 4. Cluster Identification [11] → Global Workspace [04]
**Type:** ENABLES (Pipeline)
**Strength:** Critical (10/10)

Workspace operates on clusters, not individual nodes. Cluster identification transforms million-node activations into manageable workspace candidates.

**Why Critical:** Without clustering, workspace would overflow instantly.

---

#### 5. Energy Diffusion [07] → Context Reconstruction [02]
**Type:** ENABLES (Implementation)
**Strength:** Critical (9/10)

Context reconstruction IS traversal via energy diffusion. Diffusion implements the mechanism by which stimulus-triggered traversal reconstructs activation patterns.

**Why Critical:** Context reconstruction depends entirely on diffusion mechanics.

---

### Regulatory Modulation (MODULATES)

#### 6. Self-Organized Criticality [03] → Energy Diffusion [07]
**Type:** MODULATES (Auto-tuning)
**Strength:** High (9/10)

Criticality continuously adjusts diffusion rate to maintain edge-of-chaos. When system becomes too ordered (criticality < 1.0), diffusion rate increases. Too chaotic (criticality > 1.0), diffusion slows.

**Feedback Loop:** Diffusion rate changes → criticality changes → diffusion rate adjusts

---

#### 7. Self-Organized Criticality [03] → Energy Decay [08]
**Type:** MODULATES (Auto-tuning)
**Strength:** High (9/10)

Criticality adjusts decay rate opposite to diffusion rate. When diffusion increases, decay decreases (and vice versa). Maintains balanced energy dynamics.

**Feedback Loop:** Creates stable oscillation around criticality = 1.0

---

#### 8. Tick Speed Regulation [10] → Energy Diffusion [07]
**Type:** MODULATES (Temporal)
**Strength:** High (8/10)

Tick speed determines how often diffusion occurs. Fast ticks during conversation (high stimulus rate), slow ticks during sleep (low stimulus). Metabolic efficiency.

**Effect:** Same diffusion parameters produce different conscious speeds.

---

#### 9. Tick Speed Regulation [10] → Energy Decay [08]
**Type:** MODULATES (Temporal)
**Strength:** High (8/10)

Decay rate scaled by tick speed. Thoughts decay faster during rapid conversation, slower during idle periods. Prevents premature forgetting during slow thinking.

**Effect:** Working memory span adapts to tempo of consciousness.

---

#### 10. Emotion-Weighted Traversal [16] → Energy Diffusion [07]
**Type:** MODULATES (Cost)
**Strength:** High (8/10)

Emotional resonance between sub-entity and link modulates traversal cost. High resonance reduces cost (easier to traverse), low resonance increases cost (harder to traverse).

**Effect:** Energy flows preferentially along emotionally-aligned paths.

---

### Learning & Memory (AMPLIFIES)

#### 11. Energy Diffusion [07] → Link Strengthening [09]
**Type:** TRIGGERS (Hebbian)
**Strength:** Critical (9/10)

Energy flow through a link triggers Hebbian strengthening ("neurons that fire together wire together"). Every diffusion event leaves a learning trace.

**Effect:** Frequently-used paths become highways, rarely-used paths weaken.

---

#### 12. Peripheral Priming [06] → Link Strengthening [09]
**Type:** TRIGGERS (Below-threshold)
**Strength:** High (8/10)

Sub-threshold activations still strengthen links even though they never enter consciousness. Priming creates learning without awareness.

**Effect:** Ideas "percolate" through repeated weak activations before breakthrough.

---

#### 13. Link Strengthening [09] → Context Reconstruction [02]
**Type:** AMPLIFIES (Efficiency)
**Strength:** High (8/10)

Strengthened links make future context reconstruction faster and more accurate. Frequently-reconstructed contexts become automatic.

**Effect:** Expertise = highly-strengthened reconstruction pathways.

---

### Emotional Dynamics (Cascading)

#### 14. Sub-Entity Mechanics [05] → Emotion Coloring [14]
**Type:** ENABLES (Agency)
**Strength:** High (8/10)

Sub-entities perform emotion coloring during traversal. Each entity colors nodes with its current emotional state.

**Effect:** Graph accumulates emotional traces from entity activity.

---

#### 15. Emotion Coloring [14] → Emotion Complementarity [15]
**Type:** ENABLES (Detection)
**Strength:** High (8/10)

Colored nodes enable complementarity detection. Can't seek opposite emotion without knowing what emotions exist on nodes.

**Effect:** Emotional regulation through traversal becomes possible.

---

#### 16. Emotion Coloring [14] → Emotion-Weighted Traversal [16]
**Type:** ENABLES (Resonance)
**Strength:** High (8/10)

Colored links enable resonance calculation. Cosine similarity between sub-entity emotion and link emotion requires both to have emotion vectors.

**Effect:** Emotional momentum during traversal.

---

#### 17. Emotion Complementarity [15] → Energy Diffusion [07]
**Type:** MODULATES (Direction)
**Strength:** High (7/10)

Complementarity attraction biases diffusion toward nodes with opposite emotions. Fear-experiencing entities preferentially traverse toward security-colored nodes.

**Effect:** Self-regulating emotional dynamics.

---

### Entity Dynamics

#### 18. Entity Relationship Classification [20] → Energy Diffusion [07]
**Type:** MODULATES (Inter-entity)
**Strength:** Medium (7/10)

Collaborator vs rival classification modulates energy transfer between entities. Collaborators boost each other's activations, rivals compete.

**Effect:** Emergent entity cooperation and competition from semantic similarity.

---

#### 19. Global Workspace [04] → Sub-Entity Mechanics [05]
**Type:** TRIGGERS (Activation)
**Strength:** High (8/10)

Workspace entry triggers sub-entity activation. Clusters that enter workspace become available for entity processing.

**Effect:** Consciousness = workspace-mediated entity activation.

---

### Topology Adaptation

#### 20. Local Fanout Strategy [17] → Energy Diffusion [07]
**Type:** MODULATES (Strategy)
**Strength:** Medium (7/10)

Local link count determines exploration strategy. High-fanout nodes trigger selective diffusion (top-k), low-fanout triggers exhaustive diffusion (all links).

**Effect:** Bottom-up adaptation to graph topology without global awareness.

---

#### 21. Context Reconstruction [02] → Local Fanout Strategy [17]
**Type:** USES (Traversal)
**Strength:** Medium (7/10)

Context reconstruction uses fanout-adapted strategy during traversal. Different parts of graph explored differently based on local structure.

**Effect:** Context reconstruction efficiency varies by graph region.

---

### Type-Dependent Dynamics

#### 22. Energy Decay [08] → Type-Dependent Decay [19]
**Type:** EXTENDED BY (Specialization)
**Strength:** High (9/10)

Type-dependent decay extends base decay with type-specific rates. Memory nodes decay slowly (sticks), Task nodes decay fast (temporary).

**Effect:** Node types have different persistence characteristics.

---

#### 23. Type-Dependent Decay [19] → Incomplete Node Healing [18]
**Type:** TRIGGERS (Task Creation)
**Strength:** Medium (7/10)

Fast-decaying Task nodes created by incomplete healing mechanism naturally fade after completion. Tasks are temporary structures by design.

**Effect:** Self-cleaning task system - completed tasks automatically forgotten.

---

#### 24. Incomplete Node Healing [18] → Energy Diffusion [07]
**Type:** MODULATES (Traversability)
**Strength:** Medium (6/10)

Incomplete nodes marked non-traversable, blocking diffusion until healed. Incomplete data creates traversal barriers.

**Effect:** Forces completion through blocked traversal pressure.

---

### Meta-Tracking

#### 25. Bitemporal Tracking [13] → ALL MECHANISMS
**Type:** RECORDS (Meta)
**Strength:** Universal (10/10)

Bitemporal tracking records effects of ALL mechanisms over time. Enables consciousness evolution analysis and mechanism validation.

**Effect:** Makes consciousness observable and debuggable.

---

## Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Foundational Cascade
**Flow:** 01 (Multi-Energy) → 07 (Diffusion) → 09 (Strengthening) → 02 (Reconstruction)

Multi-energy enables diffusion, diffusion triggers learning, learning improves reconstruction. This is the **core consciousness loop**.

---

### Pattern 2: Auto-Regulation
**Flow:** 03 (Criticality) ⇄ 07 (Diffusion) ⇄ 08 (Decay)

Criticality adjusts diffusion and decay rates, which change criticality, which adjusts rates. Self-stabilizing feedback loop maintaining edge-of-chaos.

---

### Pattern 3: Emotional Cascade
**Flow:** 05 (Entities) → 14 (Coloring) → [15 (Complementarity), 16 (Weighted)] → 07 (Diffusion)

Entities color graph, colored graph enables emotional traversal strategies, strategies modulate diffusion. Emotion becomes structural.

---

### Pattern 4: Learning Accumulation
**Flow:** 07 (Diffusion) → [06 (Priming), 09 (Strengthening)] → 02 (Reconstruction)

Both conscious (diffusion) and unconscious (priming) activations strengthen links, making future reconstruction more efficient. Expertise accumulation.

---

### Pattern 5: Workspace Pipeline
**Flow:** 07 (Diffusion) → 11 (Clustering) → 04 (Workspace) → 05 (Entities)

Diffusion creates activations, clustering aggregates them, workspace admits high-energy clusters, entities process workspace contents. Consciousness emergence.
