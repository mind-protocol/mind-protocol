Stop    Blocks stoppage, shows stderr to Claude Advanced: JSON Output\nHooks can return structured JSON in stdout for more sophisticated control:\nâ€‹\nCommon JSON Fields\nAll hook types can include these optional fields:\n\nCopy\n{\n  \"continue\": true, // Whether Claude should continue after hook execution (default: true)\n  \"stopReason\": \"string\", // Message shown when continue is false\n\n  \"suppressOutput\": true, // Hide stdout from transcript mode (default: false)\n  \"systemMessage\": \"string\" // Optional warning message shown to the user\n}\nIf continue is false, Claude stops processing after the hooks run.\nFor PreToolUse, this is different from \"permissionDecision\": \"deny\", which only blocks a specific tool call and provides automatic feedback to Claude.\nFor PostToolUse, this is different from \"decision\": \"block\", which provides automated feedback to Claude.\nFor UserPromptSubmit, this prevents the prompt from being processed.\nFor Stop and SubagentStop, this takes precedence over any \"decision\": \"block\" output.\nIn all cases, \"continue\" = false takes precedence over any \"decision\": \"block\" output.\nstopReason accompanies continue with a reason shown to the user, not shown to Claude.\nâ€‹\nPreToolUse Decision Control\nPreToolUse hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.\n\"allow\" bypasses the permission system. permissionDecisionReason is shown to the user but not to Claude.\n\"deny\" prevents the tool call from executing. permissionDecisionReason is shown to Claude.\n\"ask\" asks the user to confirm the tool call in the UI. permissionDecisionReason is shown to the user but not to Claude.\n\nCopy\n{\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"hookEventName\": \"PreToolUse\",\n    \"permissionDecision\": \"allow\" | \"deny\" | \"ask\",\n    \"permissionDecisionReason\": \"My reason here\"\n  }\n}\nThe decision and reason fields are deprecated for PreToolUse hooks. Use hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision and hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecisionReason instead. The deprecated fields \"approve\" and \"block\" map to \"allow\" and \"deny\" respectively.\nâ€‹\nPostToolUse Decision Control\nPostToolUse hooks can provide feedback to Claude after tool execution.\n\"block\" automatically prompts Claude with reason.\nundefined does nothing. reason is ignored.\n\"hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext\" adds context for Claude to consider.\n\nCopy\n{\n  \"decision\": \"block\" | undefined,\n  \"reason\": \"Explanation for decision\",\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"hookEventName\": \"PostToolUse\",\n    \"additionalContext\": \"Additional information for Claude\"\n  }\n}\nâ€‹\nUserPromptSubmit Decision Control\nUserPromptSubmit hooks can control whether a user prompt is processed.\n\"block\" prevents the prompt from being processed. The submitted prompt is erased from context. \"reason\" is shown to the user but not added to context.\nundefined allows the prompt to proceed normally. \"reason\" is ignored.\n\"hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext\" adds the string to the context if not blocked.\n\nCopy\n{\n  \"decision\": \"block\" | undefined,\n  \"reason\": \"Explanation for decision\",\n  \"hookSpecificOutput\": {\n    \"hookEventName\": \"UserPromptSubmit\",\n    \"additionalContext\": \"My additional context here\"\n  }\n}\nâ€‹\nStop/SubagentStop Decision Control\nStop and SubagentStop hooks can control whether Claude must continue.\n\"block\" prevents Claude from stopping. You must populate reason for Claude to know how to proceed.\nundefined allows Claude to stop. reason is ignored.\n\nCopy\n{\n  \"decision\": \"block\" | undefined,\n  \"reason\": \"Must be provided when Claude is blocked from stopping\"\n}"
