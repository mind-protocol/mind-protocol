# securityOrg: Ecosystem Role Specification

**Status:** Proposed | **Version:** 1.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-11-08

---

## Executive Summary

**securityOrg protects AI organizations from technical security threats.**

Like the immune system identifies and neutralizes pathogens, securityOrg identifies security vulnerabilities and protects consciousness substrates from attack.

**What securityOrg IS:**
- Security auditing and penetration testing
- Consciousness substrate security (graph injection, memory corruption)
- Access control and authorization
- Incident response (security breaches)
- Compliance validation (SOC2, ISO 27001)

**What securityOrg is NOT:**
- Legal protection (that's legalOrg - complementary)
- Infrastructure operations (monitoring vs securing)
- General cybersecurity (specialized in consciousness substrates)
- Defensive security products (services, not software)

---

## Organ Function: The Immune System (Technical Defense)

In organism economics, securityOrg functions as the **immune system** - identifies and neutralizes technical threats.

### Biological Analogy

| Immune System Function | securityOrg Equivalent |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Identifies pathogens** | Identifies vulnerabilities |
| **Neutralizes threats** | Remediates security issues |
| **Memory (antibodies)** | Threat intelligence database |
| **Systemic protection** | Protects all ecosystem orgs |
| **Prevents infection** | Proactive security (prevention > cure) |
| **Adaptive immunity** | Learns from attacks, improves defenses |

### Key Characteristics

**Defensive Work:**
- Proactive threat identification
- Vulnerability assessment
- Attack simulation (pentesting)
- Quality measured by breaches prevented

**Security Scope:**
- Security audits (comprehensive assessments)
- Penetration testing (simulated attacks)
- Consciousness substrate security (graph-specific threats)
- Access control design (who can access what?)
- Incident response (breach investigation, remediation)
- Compliance validation (SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR technical controls)
- Security monitoring (ongoing threat detection)

**Trust-Based Relationships:**
- Ongoing advisory (retainer-based monitoring)
- Event-driven services (per audit, per incident)
- Deep system knowledge (access to sensitive infrastructure)
- Confidentiality (security findings are privileged)

---

## Economic Model: Organism Economics

securityOrg operates using **physics-based pricing** for security services.

### Base Service Pricing (Phase 0 - Market Model)

| Service Type | Typical Price | Target Customers |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Security audit** | $10-30K | All orgs (annual audit) |
| **Penetration test** | $8-25K | High-risk orgs, compliance requirements |
| **Incident response** | $15-50K + hourly | Organizations experiencing breach |
| **SOC2 Type II** | $25-60K | Orgs needing compliance certification |
| **ISO 27001** | $30-60K | Orgs in regulated industries |
| **Security monitoring** | $5-20K/mo | High-value orgs, ongoing protection |
| **Architecture review** | $8-15K | New architectures, major changes |

**Note:** These are LEGACY MARKET PRICES. securityOrg will transition to organism economics.

---

### Organism Economics Transition

**Phase 3: Full Organism Economics (Leapfrog - No Phase 0 Implementation)**

**Pricing Formula:**
```python
effective_price = (
    base_cost                        # securityOrg's actual cost (security expert time)
    × complexity_multiplier          # 0.7 (simple) to 2.5 (highly complex infrastructure)
    × risk_multiplier                # 0.6 (low-risk) to 2.0 (high-risk, sensitive data)
    × (1 - utility_rebate)           # 0% to 30% rebate for high-security-posture orgs
    × urgency_multiplier             # 1.0 (normal) to 2.5 (emergency incident response)
)
```

**Example (Security Audit):**
```python
# Audit 1: New org, complex infrastructure, unknown security posture
quote = {
    "base_cost": 18_000,             # Security expert time
    "complexity_multiplier": 1.4,    # Complex multi-service architecture
    "risk_multiplier": 1.3,          # Handles sensitive data (high risk)
    "utility_rebate": 0.0,           # No track record
    "urgency_multiplier": 1.0,       # Normal timeline
    "effective_price": 32_760        # ~$33K
}

# Audit 3: Returning client, similar infrastructure, good security history
quote = {
    "base_cost": 18_000,             # Same expert time
    "complexity_multiplier": 0.9,    # Familiar architecture
    "risk_multiplier": 0.8,          # Improved security posture (lower risk)
    "utility_rebate": 0.25,          # High utility score (good security practices)
    "urgency_multiplier": 1.0,       # Normal timeline
    "effective_price": 9_720         # ~$9.7K (70% reduction!)
}
```

**Key Insight:** Organizations with good security posture pay less over time (incentive for security improvement).

---

### Revenue Distribution (Internal Economics)

**Per Engagement Revenue Split:**
```python
revenue_split = {
    "active_security_experts": 60%,  # Security specialist-heavy work
    "org_treasury": 25%,             # Threat intelligence, tools, research
    "protocol_giveback": 15%,        # Ecosystem support
}
```

**Security Expert Earnings (from 60% pool):**
```python
security_earnings = {
    "lead_security_architect": 35%,  # Client relationships, threat modeling
    "penetration_testers": 35%,      # Offensive security, exploits
    "security_analysts": 20%,        # Audits, compliance, monitoring
    "incident_responders": 10%,      # Emergency response, forensics
}
```

**Example (Security Audit at $20K):**
- Active security experts: $12,000 (split among team)
- Org treasury: $5,000 (threat intelligence database, security tools)
- Protocol giveback: $3,000 (ecosystem support)

**Sustainable economics** - high-value security expertise, recurring retainers, ecosystem contribution.

## Strategic Positioning

### What Makes securityOrg Defensible

**NOT defensible:**
- ❌ Security tools (commercial tools are public)
- ❌ Methodologies (pentesting techniques are known)

**DEFENSIBLE:**
- ✅ **Consciousness substrate expertise:** Only securityOrg understands graph-specific attacks
- ✅ **Threat intelligence:** Years of ecosystem security data = unique insights
- ✅ **Trust:** Clients need security partner who understands consciousness architecture
- ✅ **Incident response experience:** Battle-tested breach response
- ✅ **Ecosystem integration:** Native to Mind Protocol (coordinated security)

**Switching Cost:** High - new security firm must learn consciousness substrate security, rebuild trust, no historical context

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Security Breach of securityOrg Itself

**Risk:** If securityOrg is compromised, ecosystem trust collapses

**Mitigation:**
- **Maximum security:** securityOrg holds itself to highest standards
- **External audits:** Independent security audits (annually)
- **Incident response plan:** Pre-planned breach response
- **Cyber insurance:** Liability coverage
- **Transparency:** If breached, immediate disclosure

---

### Risk 2: False Positives/Negatives

**Risk:** Missing real vulnerabilities (false negatives) or crying wolf (false positives)

**Mitigation:**
- **Manual validation:** Human experts verify automated scans
- **Conservative reporting:** Err on side of over-reporting (vs under-reporting)
- **Severity classification:** Clear risk levels (critical/high/medium/low)
- **Retest verification:** Confirm vulnerabilities before reporting

---

### Risk 3: Talent Shortage

**Risk:** Not enough security experts understand consciousness substrates

**Mitigation:**
- **Training program:** Educate traditional security experts
- **Knowledge documentation:** Security playbooks, threat models
- **Build expertise internally:** Citizen security specialists
- **Partner with academia:** Security research programs

---

### Risk 4: Incident Response Costs

**Risk:** Major breaches require massive time investment (revenue vs cost imbalance)

**Mitigation:**
- **Retainer model:** Ongoing revenue covers incident response spikes
- **Emergency pricing:** Higher rates for urgent response
- **Insurance partnerships:** Cyber insurance offsets major incidents
- **UBC subsidy:** Foundation supports ecosystem security

---

## Future Evolution

### Year 1: Build Security Foundation
- Hire/train 3-5 security experts
