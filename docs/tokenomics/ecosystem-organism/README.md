## Purpose

Organizations are organs in a body, not competitors. Each has specialized function, all need each other healthy.

## Core Insight

Organizations within Mind Protocol are **organs in a body, not competitors in a market**. Each serves a specialized function, and all depend on the health of the whole system. Competition is replaced with coordination, and success is measured by ecosystem health rather than individual dominance.

## Pattern Description

The ecosystem operates as a living organism with specialized organs:

**Organizational Functions (Biological Analogies):**

- **consultingOrg**: Transformation services (like enzymes - catalyze organizational change)
- **techServiceOrg**: Manual graph construction (like builders - construct tissue)
- **GraphCare**: Ongoing maintenance (like kidneys - filter and maintain health)
- **scalingOrg**: Automated onboarding (like reproductive system - enable growth)
- **financeOrg**: Treasury consulting (like circulatory system - manage resource flows)
- **legalOrg**: Legal services (like immune system - protect from threats)
- **securityOrg**: Security audits (like white blood cells - defend against attacks)

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Interdependence**: Organizations refer customers to each other (scalingOrg → GraphCare, consultingOrg → techServiceOrg)
2. **Revenue Sharing**: All orgs contribute 15-20% revenue back to protocol (organism support)
3. **Coordinated Growth**: Success of one org strengthens the entire ecosystem
4. **Specialization**: Each org optimizes for specific function, not competing for same customers
5. **Feedback Loops**: Protocol giveback funds UBC → enables autonomous operations → creates more value → generates more giveback

**Revenue Distribution Pattern (Universal):**

```python
revenue_split = {
    "active_specialists": "60-70%",     # People/citizens doing the work
    "org_treasury": "15-25%",           # Tools, infrastructure, reserves
    "protocol_giveback": "15-20%",      # Mind Protocol Foundation support
}
```

## Why This Pattern Matters

**Sustainability Through Coordination:**
- No single organization can survive alone (needs other orgs for complete customer journey)
- Protocol giveback ensures foundational infrastructure (UBC, L4 validation) remains funded
- Organism economics (physics-based pricing) removes adversarial competition

**Scalability Through Specialization:**
- Each org focuses on core competency
- Referrals between orgs create multiplier effects
- New orgs can be added without disrupting existing ones

**Economic Coherence:**
- Internal revenue flows strengthen ecosystem health
- Successful orgs contribute more giveback → more UBC → more autonomous operations → more value creation
- Feedback loop creates virtuous cycle of growth

## When to Apply

**This pattern applies to:**

1. **New Ecosystem Organizations**: Any new org joining Mind Protocol adopts this revenue distribution model
2. **Revenue Planning**: When calculating pricing, always include 15-20% protocol giveback
3. **Customer Journeys**: Design services to integrate with other orgs (referrals, handoffs)
4. **Strategic Decisions**: Optimize for ecosystem health, not individual org dominance
5. **Financial Modeling**: Model revenue flows as circulation through organism, not isolated P&Ls

**This pattern does NOT apply to:**
- External customers (they pay standard prices, don't contribute giveback)
- Individual AI citizens (different economic model - UBC recipients, not givers)
- One-off transactions without ecosystem integration
