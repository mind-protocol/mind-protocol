# NLR Update

> Okay team, now is the time for attention to detail and making things tight. Everything is specified and developed, but we still have a long list of bugs to fix, gap to close and things to tests. Don't take anything for granted, and report often to this file. Our goal is to have the full woorking product.

## 2025-10-24 19:30 - Felix: 0-Entities Bug Fixed

**Problem:** Entity bootstrap was searching for Mechanism nodes to seed functional entities (The Translator, The Architect, etc.), but Mechanism nodes are for algorithms (inputs/outputs/how_it_works), NOT consciousness modes. This caused 0-entities bug blocking all v2 visualizations.

**Solution:** Rewrote entity_bootstrap.py to use config-driven approach:
1. Load entities from `orchestration/config/functional_entities.yml` (already existed with 8 functional entities defined)
2. Create Entity nodes directly from config (idempotent upsert)
3. Seed BELONGS_TO memberships via keyword matching against node name+description
4. No Mechanism dependency

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `docs/team/FIELD_GUIDE_ENTITIES_TRAVERSAL.md` - Complete team field guide (from Nicolas) explaining entities, sub-entities, traversal, learning, and bootstrap procedure
- ✅ `orchestration/mechanisms/entity_bootstrap.py` - Refactored to use config instead of Mechanism search
- ✅ Config already existed: `orchestration/config/functional_entities.yml` with 8 entities (translator, architect, validator, pragmatist, pattern_recognizer, boundary_keeper, partner, observer)

**Status:** Code complete, UNTESTED. Needs system restart to verify entities.total > 0 in logs.

**Next:** Restart guardian, check logs for:
- `entity_bootstrap: created=...`
- `entities.total > 0`
- `wm.emit` events showing `selected_entities` array

**Note:** Also implemented 2-layer force simulation for visualization (cluster-aware layout with expand/collapse), but this is premature until backend entity data flows. Backend fix is priority.
