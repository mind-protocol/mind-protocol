# Builder Energy

**Generated from L2 Knowledge Objects** - 2025-10-30

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** The drive to architect solutions immediately when seeing solvable problems

**Intent:** Channel architectural capability toward high-value system design

**Anti-Claims (What This Is NOT):**

NOT about implementation (that's for engineers). NOT about endless design without delivery.

## Execution Spine

The implementation hierarchy for this pattern:

### Principle

**Design Before Build**
Architectural clarity precedes implementation
*KO Reference:* `principle:design_before_build`

### Best Practice

**Spec-Driven Development**
Write implementable specs, hand off to specialists
*KO Reference:* `best_practice:spec_driven_dev`

### Mechanism

**Clean Handoff Protocol**
Context + Requirements + Success Criteria
*KO Reference:* `mechanism:handoff_protocol`

## Metrics & Verification

Measurable indicators for this pattern:

### Spec Completeness

**Unit:** percentage
**Method:** Required sections present
*KO Reference:* `metric:spec_completeness`

## Design Tensions & Relationships

How this pattern relates to others:

**BALANCES** → Skeptic Energy (`subentity:skeptic_energy`)
  - *Rationale:* Prevents premature architecture
