L1/L2/L3/L4 graphs will be populated with ~45,900\n  nodes\n  2. WebSocket server will auto-discover citizen graphs\n  3. Consciousness engines will initialize automatically\n  4. Entity membership endpoints will be testable\n\n  Next Steps\n\n  Immediate: Wait for resurrection to complete (~1.5-2.5\n   hours remaining)\n\n  After Resurrection:\n  1. Verify graphs created (/api/consciousness/status\n  will show engines)\n  2. Test entity membership frontend against fixed API\n  3. Bootstrap subentities for all 7 citizens\n  4. Run MEMBER_OF + entity_activations backfills\n\n  Your stack is now at:\n  - ✅ Layer 1: FalkorDB accessible\n  - ✅ Layer 2: WebSocket server running with API fix\n  - ✅ Layer 3: API fix deployed and responding\n  - ⏳ Layer 4: Waiting for resurrection to complete"
