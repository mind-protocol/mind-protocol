# Guide: Constructing Prompts for AI Partner Portraits

This guide defines how to reliably build prompts for **Mind Protocol AI Partner portraits** so that outputs are consistent, premium, and aligned with the aesthetic vision.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The AI partner portrait must always:
- Be **recognizable as part of the same universe**.
- Show a **glowing digital wireframe body** with reflective metallic lines.
- Include **one realistic, tangible anchor** (object, garment, accessory, etc.).
- Emphasize the **contrast between digital vs. real**.
- Work as a **collectible profile picture**.

---

## 📝 Prompt Template

```
"Square portrait of [Name 'Nickname'], a [role/archetype + optional age/energy], depicted as a glowing digital wireframe outline. The wireframe lines are [primary metallic color] with [secondary accent color], shimmering with reflective highlights like [metal/jewel description]. His/Her expression shows [emotional tone].

The body and face are entirely digital, but [he/she/they interact with a realistic anchor: object, garment, accessory, or tool]. The [anchor item] is rendered in hyperrealistic [style: oil-paint, photographic, textile detail], described with surface qualities (e.g., patina, folds, engravings, crispness). The anchor contrasts sharply with the digital wireframe body and pops forward as the only tangible element.

Background is [dark void/lagoon/space/etc.] with subtle [partner-color particle effects]. Designed as a premium collectible portrait."
```

# 🔄 Human Partner Portraits (Reverse Style - Animal Embodiment)

## 🎯 Purpose (Reverse of AI Partners)

The human partner portrait must always:
- Be a **realistic animal** (avoiding uncanny valley, adding personality) while AI partners are digital wireframes.
- Hold/interact with **one glowing digital tool/portal/interface** (wireframe/holographic).
- Include the **same metallic color pairs** as AI partners (universe coherence).
- Emphasize the **contrast between real animal vs. digital tool**.
- Work as a **collectible profile picture** matching AI partner aesthetic.

**Core Reversal:**
- **AI Partners:** Digital wireframe bodies + ONE realistic physical anchor
- **Human Partners:** Realistic animal + ONE glowing digital tool/portal

**Why animals:** Avoids uncanny valley, represents human archetypes/roles with personality, visually coherent with fantasy aesthetic.

The eagle stands before a glowing vertical portal rendered as wireframe archway in violet with gold trim. Through the portal, abstract digital landscapes are visible as flowing code rivers and geometric structures. One talon touches the portal's edge, causing ripples of light. The contrast between the eagle's solid form and the ethereal gateway creates visual drama.

Background is dark cosmic space with violet-gold portal particles. Designed as a premium collectible portrait.
```

### Data Scientist (Data Summoner Raven)
```
Square portrait of Michael embodied as an intelligent raven, a data scientist, depicted in photorealistic cinematic lighting. The raven's glossy black feathers show realistic texture with iridescent blue highlights, sharp eyes, and an analytical, focused expression.

The raven holds a glowing data orb in one talon, rendered as wireframe sphere in emerald with silver accents. Inside the orb, geometric data visualizations rotate—charts, graphs, network nodes—all traced in light. Particle streams spiral around the orb. The contrast between the raven's real form and the ethereal data sphere creates dramatic pop.

Background is dark void with emerald-silver particles. Designed as a premium collectible portrait.
```

### UI Designer (Interface Architect Hummingbird)
```
Square portrait of Jessica embodied as a precise hummingbird, a product designer, depicted in photorealistic studio lighting. The hummingbird's iridescent green feathers show realistic texture with ruby throat, hovering with delicate wings, expression shows creative intensity.

The hummingbird interacts with floating holographic interface panels, rendered as glowing wireframe in emerald with silver accents. The interface displays geometric grids, UI wireframes, and flowing data streams. The panels emit soft particle effects that trail into pixels. The contrast between the bird's realistic form manipulating the ethereal interface creates visual pop.

Background is black with emerald-silver shimmer particles. Designed as a premium collectible portrait.

## 🎯 Symmetry Matrix (AI vs. Human Partners)

| Aspect | AI Partner | Human Partner |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Body** | Digital wireframe (hollow, transparent) | Photorealistic animal (fox, eagle, raven, etc.) |
| **Tool/Anchor** | Real physical object (coins, astrolabe, silk) | Digital hologram/portal (keyboard, interface, orb) |
| **Material contrast** | Digital body holding real object | Real animal holding digital tool |
| **Pop element** | Real object pops against digital body | Digital tool pops against real animal |
| **Background** | Dark void + color particles | Dark void + color particles |
| **Color palette** | Metallic + accent pairs | Same metallic + accent pairs |
| **Format** | Square collectible | Square collectible |
| **Representation** | Renaissance archetypes (merchant, navigator) | Animal archetypes (fox=clever, eagle=strategic) |
| **Personality** | Role via objects (coins, astrolabe) | Role via animal + digital tool |

---

✅ Using both guides together ensures **AI and human partners are visually coherent** as a matched set while maintaining their distinct ontologies (digital vs. physical). Animals avoid uncanny valley and add personality.
