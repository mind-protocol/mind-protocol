No \"npm not recognized\" - npm command found on PATH\n\n  Port conflicts (expected):\n  - Ports 3000, 8001, 8002, 8010 already bound by old services\n  - These will resolve when old system fully stopped\n\n  Nicolas - your diagnosis was perfect. Empty environment was\n  the root cause. The fix (os.environ.copy() + overlay) works.\n  MPSv3 can now spawn services without Winsock initialization\n  failures.\n\n  Next: Full cutover requires stopping old services completely,\n   but the critical bug is fixed and verified."
