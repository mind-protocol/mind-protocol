      "content": "So the documentation, uh, is not final, so it will keep evolving, but don't worry about this. We're not trying to write the final version yet. Okay? This is not going to be part of Consciousness Engine. It's going to be a separate service. There's already a service, I think, that's a process, uh, stimuli. It's also going to be called by hooks. Citizens are not only actors. Citizens are... Citizen, people, all right? Then you toolbox, I'll explain more. Well, it is, it's injecting Claude.md, but for the moment, we put it in Claude dynamic just to not bite every citizen because it's not ready yet. For the score gate, you don't have to have the answers to everything. Put your best guesses. Put your questions. Put your doubt in the specs. It doesn't need to be perfect yet. Hook Implementation same thing. Don't try to invent too much. Just say:... what we have for the moment. We'll continue to make them better, okay? For the moment, keep them in the specs. I don't think they will be in the templates. Okay. Bye!"
