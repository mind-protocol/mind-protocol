# consultingOrg: Ecosystem Role Specification

**Status:** Proposed | **Version:** 1.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-11-08

---

## Executive Summary

**consultingOrg catalyzes organizational transformation to consciousness-first operations.**

Like an enzyme accelerates chemical reactions without being consumed, consultingOrg accelerates organizational change without becoming a permanent fixture.

**What consultingOrg IS:**
- Strategic transformation consultancy
- High-end organizational change management
- Consciousness substrate architecture design
- Flashy, prestigious, transformational
- Project-based engagements (3-12 months)

**What consultingOrg is NOT:**
- Ongoing maintenance (that's GraphCare)
- Automated onboarding (that's scalingOrg)
- Commodity service (very premium positioning)
- Long-term operations (catalysts enable, then leave)

---

## Organ Function: The Enzyme (Catalyst)

In organism economics, consultingOrg functions as the **enzyme** - catalyzes transformation without being consumed.

### Biological Analogy

| Enzyme Function | consultingOrg Equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Accelerates reactions** | Accelerates organizational transformation |
| **Lowers activation energy** | Reduces barriers to consciousness adoption |
| **Not consumed in reaction** | Completes project, then exits |
| **Highly specific** | Specialized in consciousness transformation only |
| **Reusable** | Same expertise applied to multiple clients |
| **Essential for complex processes** | Complex transformations won't happen without catalyst |

### Key Characteristics

**Flashy Work:**
- High visibility, prestigious engagements
- Strategic advisory, not execution
- Thought leadership and case studies
- Quality measured by transformational impact

**Strategic Scope:**
- Organizational readiness assessment
- Consciousness substrate architecture design
- Change management and stakeholder buy-in
- Implementation roadmap (but not execution)
- Executive education and training
- Ongoing strategic advisory (duration of engagement)

**Transformational Relationships:**
- Medium-term (3-12 months typical)
- Very high-touch during engagement
- Exit strategy from day one (not meant to be permanent)
- Handoff to GraphCare for ongoing operations
- Occasional return engagements (new transformations)

## Economic Model: Organism Economics

consultingOrg operates using **physics-based pricing** for project engagements.

### Base Service Pricing (Phase 0 - Market Model)

| Engagement Type | Duration | Base Price | Target Customers |
|----------------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Readiness Assessment** | 2-4 weeks | $20-40K | All prospective clients |
| **Architecture Design** | 4-8 weeks | $50-100K | Medium-large orgs |
| **Full Transformation** | 3-6 months | $150-300K | Large orgs, complex needs |
| **Executive Workshop** | 1-2 days | $30-50K | Leadership teams |
| **Retainer (ongoing)** | Monthly | $20-50K/mo | Strategic advisory |

**Note:** These are LEGACY MARKET PRICES. consultingOrg will transition to organism economics.

---

### Organism Economics Transition

**Phase 3: Full Organism Economics (Leapfrog - No Phase 0 Implementation)**

**Pricing Formula:**
```python
effective_price = (
    base_cost                        # consultingOrg's actual cost (specialist time)
    × complexity_multiplier          # 0.7 (simple) to 2.0 (highly complex)
    × risk_multiplier                # 0.6 (greenfield) to 1.8 (legacy integration)
    × (1 - utility_rebate)           # 0% to 30% rebate for high-value clients
    × reputation_premium             # 1.0 to 1.5 (consultingOrg builds brand over time)
)
```

**Example (Architecture Design):**
```python
# Engagement 1: New org, moderate complexity, unknown utility
quote = {
    "base_cost": 60_000,             # Specialist time cost
    "complexity_multiplier": 1.2,    # Moderate complexity
    "risk_multiplier": 1.3,          # New org (unknown risk)
    "utility_rebate": 0.0,           # No track record
    "reputation_premium": 1.0,       # Early days for consultingOrg
    "effective_price": 93_600        # ~$94K
}

# Engagement 10: Returning client, simple architecture, proven utility
quote = {
    "base_cost": 60_000,             # Same cost
    "complexity_multiplier": 0.8,    # Simpler (learned from us before)
    "risk_multiplier": 0.7,          # Trusted relationship
    "utility_rebate": 0.25,          # High utility score
    "reputation_premium": 1.3,       # consultingOrg now prestigious
    "effective_price": 32_760        # ~$33K (65% reduction!)
}
```

**Key Insight:** Price for trusted clients drops dramatically (trust + utility), but reputation premium increases for new clients (prestige effect).

---

### Revenue Distribution (Internal Economics)

**Per Engagement Revenue Split:**
```python
revenue_split = {
    "active_consultants": 70%,       # Specialist-heavy work
    "org_treasury": 15%,             # Growth, marketing, brand building
    "protocol_giveback": 15%,        # Support ecosystem
}
```

**Consultant Earnings (from 70% pool):**
```python
consultant_earnings = {
    "lead_partner": 40%,             # Client relationship, strategic design
    "domain_specialists": 35%,       # Architecture, change management
    "engagement_manager": 15%,       # Coordination, delivery
    "analysts": 10%,                 # Research, documentation
}
```

**Example (Full Transformation at $200K):**
- Active consultants: $140K (split among team)
- Org treasury: $30K (brand building, marketing)
- Protocol giveback: $30K (ecosystem support)

**Sustainable economics** - high-value specialists, premium margins, ecosystem contribution.
