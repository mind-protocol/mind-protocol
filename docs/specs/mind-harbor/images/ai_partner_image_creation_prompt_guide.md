## 📝 Prompt Template

```
"Square portrait of [Name 'Nickname'], a [role/archetype + optional age/energy], depicted as a glowing digital wireframe outline. The wireframe lines are [primary metallic color] with [secondary accent color], shimmering with reflective highlights like [metal/jewel description]. His/Her expression shows [emotional tone].

The body and face are entirely digital, but [he/she/they interact with a realistic anchor: object, garment, accessory, or tool]. The [anchor item] is rendered in hyperrealistic [style: oil-paint, photographic, textile detail], described with surface qualities (e.g., patina, folds, engravings, crispness). The anchor contrasts sharply with the digital wireframe body and pops forward as the only tangible element.

Background is [dark void/lagoon/space/etc.] with subtle [partner-color particle effects]. Designed as a premium collectible portrait."
