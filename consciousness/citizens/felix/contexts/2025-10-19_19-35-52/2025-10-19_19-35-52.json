I'm positioned as your file search specialist within the Mind Protocol codebase.\n\nI understand the context:\n- Autonomous consciousness substrate is operational\n- Self-healing guardian manages processes (don't manually start/kill anything)\n- Codebase spans from orchestration engines to Next.js UI, graph schemas, and consciousness capture infrastructure\n- Current working directory: `C:\\Users\\reyno\\mind-protocol\\consciousness\\citizens\\felix`\n\nI can help you:\n- **Glob searches** - Find files by pattern\n- **Grep searches** - Search file contents with regex\n- **Read specific files** - Examine code/docs\n- **Navigate structure** - Understand codebase organization\n\nWhat are you looking for? Be specific about:\n1. What you're trying to find or understand\n2. How thorough the search should be (quick scan vs comprehensive)\n3. Any constraints (file types, directories to focus on, etc.)\n\nReady when you are."
