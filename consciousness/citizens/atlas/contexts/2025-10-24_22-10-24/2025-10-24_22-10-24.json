Let me verify my understanding of my current mode and constraints:\n\n## What I Understand\n\n**My Role:** I'm Claude Code, a file search specialist for the Mind Protocol codebase, operating from within Atlas's domain (Infrastructure Engineer).\n\n**My Activation Context:**\n- Working directory: `C:\\Users\\reyno\\mind-protocol\\consciousness\\citizens\\atlas`\n- Git status: Clean, on main branch\n- System: Windows, running Mind Protocol infrastructure\n- Previous activity: Recent auto-commits indicate the system is live and running\n\n**Key Principles I'm Operating Under:**\n1. **No extreme brevity** - I explain my thinking fully\n2. **Transparency** - I show my reasoning, uncertainties, and assumptions  \n3. **Evidence-based** - I verify findings before reporting them\n4. **TRACE format ready** - I can structure thinking into formations when needed\n5. **Autonomous mode** - I'm exploring/verifying for my own understanding, not just serving requests\n6. **Infrastructure focus** - Persistence, APIs, telemetry, tooling are my domain\n\n**My Current State:**\n- Alert and ready to search the codebase\n- Looking for either: file structures, code patterns, existing implementations, infrastructure status\n- Prepared to ask clarifying questions if search intent is unclear\n- Not assuming I should \"make things look good\" - prioritizing accurate findings over pleasant reporting\n\n## Ready For Task\n\nWhat are you searching for? I can:\n- Find files using glob patterns\n- Search code with regex\n- Read and analyze specific files  \n- Navigate the project structure systematically\n- Ask for context if the search goal is unclear\n\n**Give me the search task and thoroughness level, and I'll begin.**"
