Fixed Victor's float conversion error - Added\n  defensive safe_float() function that extracts numeric\n  prefixes from corrupted values like \"0.85 Rich,\n  specific value\"\n  2. Fixed graph discovery (previous session) - Server\n  now recognizes hierarchical naming\n  3. All 6 engines successfully load their graphs -\n  Total ~1,524 nodes loaded across all citizens\n\n  ❌ Remaining Blockers\n\n  Two missing imports prevent engines from starting:\n\n  1. EntityActivationMetrics missing (5 engines: atlas,\n  iris, ada, felix, luca)\n    - Referenced in consciousness_engine_v2.py but not\n  imported\n    - Likely defined in subentity_activation.py\n    - Need to add import statement\n  2. re module error (1 engine: victor)\n    - safe_float() uses re.match() but re not accessible\n    - Import exists but may be scoped incorrectly\n\n  Progress Summary\n\n  Server running successfully:\n  - Graph discovery: ✅ 6 N1 + 1 N2 + 1 N3\n  - Graph loading: ✅ All 6 engines load successfully\n  - Engine initialization: ❌ All 6 fail on missing\n  imports\n  - API endpoints: ❌ Not functional (require running\n  engines)\n\n  Resurrection progress:\n  - Still running (bash ID defd81)\n  - ~1,100+ nodes created so far\n  - Continuous injection ongoing\n\n  The handoff document is at consciousness/citizens/vict\n  or/HANDOFF_engine_initialization_progress.md with\n  complete details on what was fixed, current errors,\n  and next steps needed.\n\n  You mentioned you already fixed the\n  EntityCohortTracker issue. The next step is to find\n  where EntityActivationMetrics is defined and add the\n  import to consciousness_engine_v2.py.\n"
