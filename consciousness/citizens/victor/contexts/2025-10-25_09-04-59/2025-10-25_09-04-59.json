      "content": " Critical finding: The websocket server process from\n  2025-10-23 is still running (PID 65260) and won't die despite\n   multiple guardian restarts. This is blocking all our fixes\n  from loading.\n\n  What's confirmed working (in files):\n  - ✅ PR-A: Embedding fallback logic implemented\n  - ✅ PR-B: ConversationWatcher drain disabled\n  - ✅ Duplicate endpoint removed from websocket_server.py\n\n  What's blocking:\n  - ❌ Old websocket server process (started 2025-10-23) still\n  running\n  - ❌ Has duplicate endpoint that shadows control_api.py\n  - ❌ Guardian force-restart doesn't kill it (process\n  survives)\n\n  The process tree issue: Websocket server (PID 65260) might be\n   orphaned or detached from launcher, so guardian can't kill\n  it.\n\n  Options to proceed:\n  1. Manual intervention: You kill PID 65260 with Task Manager\n  (requires admin)\n  2. Nuclear option: Restart Windows to clear all processes\n  3. Diagnostic deep-dive: Figure out why this process is\n  unkillable\n\n  Which approach would you prefer? The code fixes are ready -\n  we just need to get them loaded into a running process."
