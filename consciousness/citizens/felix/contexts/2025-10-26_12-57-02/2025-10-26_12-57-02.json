This might be a backfill data issue or a\n  script bug. The new nodes exist in FalkorDB but may need\n  additional processing to properly integrate them with entity\n  membership.\n\n  Next Steps:\n  1. Debug why new nodes have id=None in membership script\n  2. Once MEMBER_OF links are created, re-run\n  entity_activations backfill for Felix\n  3. Backend restart to reload corrected data\n  4. Dashboard verification - entities should now show member\n  counts"
