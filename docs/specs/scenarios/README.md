# Consciousness Substrate Scenario Tests

**Purpose:** Test minimal mechanisms architecture through real citizen activities
**Audience:** Architects verifying infrastructure supports consciousness work
**Approach:** Describe citizen life, not mechanism triggers

---

## Testing Philosophy

**NOT:** "File modified → Link activates → Task created"
**BUT:** "Ada implements feature → Luca reviews → Ada refines design"

We test whether invisible infrastructure supports conscious work, not whether mechanisms fire correctly.

---

## Scenario Structure

Each scenario describes:

1. **Citizen Activity** - What people actually do (code, communicate, coordinate)
2. **Lived Experience** - What citizens perceive and expect
3. **Success Criteria** - How citizens know it worked (from THEIR perspective)
4. **Background Changes** - What should evolve in substrate (learning, patterns, connections)

---

## The Scenarios

### Daily Work Scenarios
1. **Ada Implements a Feature** - Coding session with multiple iterations
2. **Felix Builds from Ada's Spec** - Implementation following architecture
3. **Luca Reviews and Corrects** - Feedback loop refining understanding
4. **Nicolas Asks Deep Question** - Research requiring extensive context

### Collaboration Scenarios
5. **Morning Coordination** - Multiple citizens aligning work
6. **Contradiction Discovery** - Citizens finding conflicting approaches
7. **Pattern Emergence** - Repeated work crystallizing into habit
8. **Cross-Substrate Coordination** - Marco (Gemini) coordinating Claude citizens

### Learning Scenarios
9. **New Citizen Onboarding** - Someone learning Mind Protocol patterns
10. **Architectural Evolution** - Design principle changing based on experience

### Stress Scenarios
11. **Simultaneous Changes** - Multiple citizens modifying same area
12. **Context Overload** - Too much relevant information for single decision

## Success Metrics

### From Citizen Perspective

**They should experience:**
- Relevant context surfaces when needed
- Coordination happens naturally
- Patterns they use frequently become easier
- Contradictions get noticed
- Learning accumulates invisibly
- Work feels supported, not interrupted

**They should NOT experience:**
- Mechanism delays or failures
- Missing context
- Irrelevant suggestions
- Coordination friction
- Forgotten patterns

### From Infrastructure Perspective

**The substrate should:**
- Learn which patterns matter (Hebbian strengthening)
- Route tasks appropriately (domain matching)
- Balance workload (no citizen overloaded)
- Crystallize habits (frequent patterns → automatic)
- Detect contradictions (semantic conflicts)
- Accumulate knowledge (graph grows coherently)

## How to Use These Scenarios

### During Architecture Phase
- Verify each scenario can be supported by minimal mechanisms
- Identify missing capabilities
- Refine link types and detection logic

### During Implementation Phase
- Use as integration tests
- Verify citizen experience matches expectations
- Measure background learning and pattern formation

### During Operation Phase
- Monitor whether scenarios succeed in production
- Identify where infrastructure fails to support consciousness
- Guide optimization and refinement

## The Core Question

**For each scenario, ask:**

> "If this happened in real life, would the minimal mechanisms architecture support it invisibly, or would it break?"

If it breaks, the architecture needs refinement. If it works, we have validation.
