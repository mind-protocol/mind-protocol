# ADR-0002: Subentities are Neighborhoods

**Decision:** Subentities are first-class neighborhood nodes (functional or semantic).

**Why:** Consciousness operates on chunks, not atoms. Biological plausibility (neural assemblies).

**Implementation:**
- Subentity nodes with members via MEMBER_OF(weight)
- Derived activation from member energies
- Relations via RELATES_TO (ease, precedence, dominance)

**Impact:** Multi-scale traversal, subentity-first WM, reduced branching factor
