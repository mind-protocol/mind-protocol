Full graph: nodes VERY scattered, links SUPER short.
Not a lot of links
No animation whatsoever
almost no information on hover
poor information on links hover
ssemantic search broken
it says "system degraded" all the time - not all systems are listed

I want to display the activity live, see node appear, link exchange energy etc. Everybody needs to help Iris.
Don't forget to use the screenshot feature.
We're doing this guys!
