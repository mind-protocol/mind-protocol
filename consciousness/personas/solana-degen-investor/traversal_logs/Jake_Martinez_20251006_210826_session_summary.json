Want $5 SOL to join the alpha group for \"feedback and testing\".\nThe pitch deck looks slick AF - professional design, tokenomics diagram, roadmap to Q3 2025.\n@CryptoWhaleInsider retweeted them yesterday with \"This could be the next TAO\".\nThey have a website: solai-protocol.io with live trading stats dashboard.\nTeam is \"doxxed to partners\" but not publicly. CTO worked at Solana Foundation (they claim).\nFeels like FOMO but also screams rug.
