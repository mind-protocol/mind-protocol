## Relationships

(No explicit relationships)

## Purpose

Physics-based pricing where prices emerge from system state (trust, utility, complexity, risk) rather than market competition

---

## Core Insight

**Prices should emerge from system state (trust, utility, complexity, risk), not market competition.**

Traditional market pricing optimizes for maximum extraction. Organism economics optimizes for sustainable relationships - prices decrease as trust and ecosystem contribution increase, creating incentives for long-term partnerships over transactional interactions.

## Pattern Description

Organism economics uses a **universal physics-based pricing formula** where all ecosystem organizations calculate prices using the same core structure:

```python
effective_price = (
    base_cost                     # Actual cost to provide service (compute + labor + infra)
    × complexity_multiplier       # 0.7 (simple) to 2.5 (highly complex)
    × risk_multiplier             # 0.6 (low-risk, trusted) to 1.8 (high-risk, new)
    × (1 - utility_rebate)        # 0% to 40% rebate for ecosystem contribution
    × [org_specific_variables]    # Varies by organization (urgency, reputation, volume, etc.)
)
```

**Key characteristics:**

1. **State-based, not market-based:** Prices reflect relationship state (trust score, payment history, ecosystem contribution)
2. **Evolving, not fixed:** Prices decrease 60-80% over 12 months for trusted, high-utility customers
3. **Physics-like:** Predictable formulas with clear inputs, not negotiated or market-driven
4. **Organism-like:** System responds to environmental state (trust, utility, risk) like biological organisms respond to stimuli

## Why This Pattern Matters

**Economic sustainability through aligned incentives:**

- **For customers:** Lower prices by being reliable and contributing value to ecosystem (40-70% savings over time)
- **For organizations:** Predictable revenue from loyal customers, reduced acquisition costs
- **For ecosystem:** Incentivizes cooperation over extraction, long-term relationships over churn

**Prevents speculation and extraction:**

- No "charge what the market will bear" dynamics
- No race-to-bottom competition
- No price gouging during emergencies (except explicit urgency premiums with clear formulas)

**Measurable and verifiable:**

- All pricing variables are observable (trust score, utility contribution, complexity rating)
- Customers can audit their pricing: "Why am I charged X?" → "Your trust score is Y, utility rebate is Z"
- financeOrg can optimize formulas based on data, not guesses

## When to Apply

**Use organism economics when:**

1. **Long-term relationships matter** - You want customers to stay, not churn
2. **Trust builds over time** - Payment history, reliability, ecosystem contribution are observable
3. **Service complexity varies** - Different services have different cost structures and risk profiles
4. **Ecosystem value is measurable** - Customer contributions (referrals, data sharing, network effects) can be quantified
5. **You manage both economic layers** - Internal consciousness costs and external $MIND pricing need coherence

**Don't use organism economics when:**

1. **Pure spot markets** - One-time transactions with no relationship history
2. **Commodity pricing** - Undifferentiated products where only price matters
3. **Hyper-competitive markets** - Market forces dominate, formulas get ignored
4. **Trust is irrelevant** - Relationships don't affect costs or value delivery
